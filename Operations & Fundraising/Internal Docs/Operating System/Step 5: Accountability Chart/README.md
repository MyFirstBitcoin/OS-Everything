# Step 5: Accountability Chart

## Purpose
The accountability chart defines the organizational structure based on roles rather than individuals. Each role, whether currently filled or planned for the future, has five specific responsibilities. This creates clarity around decision-making and ensures all essential functions are covered.

### Key Objectives
- Define clear organizational structure
- Establish role-based responsibilities
- Create foundation for OKRs and hiring decisions
- Enable effective decision-making

## Implementation

### Setup Process
1. **Define Structure**
   - Map out departments and functions
   - Identify all necessary roles (current and future)
   - Establish reporting lines
   - Mark future positions as "TBD" or "Open"

2. **Role Definition**
   - Assign each role five key responsibilities that are:
     * Specific and actionable
     * Non-overlapping with other roles
     * Essential to organizational success
   - Include responsibilities for future roles to guide recruitment

3. **Review and Refine**
   - Check for gaps in essential functions
   - Eliminate redundant responsibilities
   - Verify reporting relationships
   - Prioritize hiring based on critical role needs

### Best Practices
- Focus on roles, not individuals
- Keep responsibilities clear and specific
- Review and update chart quarterly
