### Evaluation Framework
1. **A Player Definition**
   A players are those who:
   - Share our Core Values
   - Meet our Operational Standards

2. **Common Scenarios**
   - Right Person, Wrong Seat: Shares core values but needs role adjustment
   - Wrong Person, Right Seat: Strong performance but misaligned with values

3. **Evaluation Process**
   - Use the analyzer template to evaluate each team member
   - Assess both values alignment and operational performance
   - Conduct evaluations quarterly
   - Document specific examples and observations

### 3-Strike Process
1. **Strike 1**
   - Discuss issues based on evaluation
   - Provide 30-day correction plan
   - Document expectations clearly

2. **Strike 2**
   - Review performance against correction plan
   - If no improvement, provide additional 30 days
   - Update correction plan as needed

3. **Strike 3**
   - If still no improvement after Strike 2
   - Move to termination
   - Document all steps taken

### Best Practices
- Be consistent in evaluations
- Use objective evidence
- Document all feedback and plans
- Follow correction process fairly
- Focus on improvement opportunities
