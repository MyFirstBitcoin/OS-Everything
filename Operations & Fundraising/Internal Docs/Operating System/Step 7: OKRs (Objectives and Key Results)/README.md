# Step 7: OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)

## Purpose
OKRs translate the responsibilities outlined in each role's Scope of Work into specific, measurable objectives. Each team member creates their own OKRs, ensuring personal ownership while maintaining alignment with organizational goals.

### Key Objectives
- Enable role owners to set clear objectives
- Create measurable results
- Ensure alignment with role responsibilities
- Track progress systematically
- Foster ownership and accountability

## Implementation

### Creation Process
1. **Hierarchical Development**
   - Board and Operations Lead create their OKRs first
   - Directors create their OKRs next
   - Staff members create their OKRs last
   - Each level aligns with the ones above

2. **Structure**
   - Each role defines 3 objectives
     * Objectives are qualitative goals that set direction
     * They describe what you want to achieve
     * They should be aspirational and inspiring
     * Example: "Build a strong education team"
   - Each objective has 3 key results
     * Key results are quantitative metrics
     * They measure progress toward the objective
     * Must be specific and measurable
     * Example: "Hire and onboard 5 new teachers by Q3"
   - Objectives align with SOW responsibilities
   - All key results should have measurable targets

3. **Review Cycle**
   - Monthly status updates (ongoing, lagging, poor)
   - Quarterly OKR review and adjustment
   - Ensure continued alignment with SOW
   - Track progress and address blockers

### Best Practices
- Create specific, measurable objectives
- Align with role responsibilities
- Make key results quantifiable
- Set challenging but achievable targets
- Update status regularly
- Use 1:1s to discuss progress
