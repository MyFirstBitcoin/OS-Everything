# Step 10: Standard Operating Procedures

## Purpose
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) document the key processes and tasks for each role, creating a self-training resource for new team members. This documentation ensures operational continuity and maintains organizational knowledge even as team members transition.

### Key Objectives
- Document key processes
- Enable self-guided training
- Maintain operational knowledge
- Support smooth role transitions
- Standardize core procedures

## Implementation

### Documentation Process
1. **Process Identification**
   - List all regular tasks and processes
   - Prioritize most important procedures
   - Include routine and periodic tasks
   - Note dependencies on other roles

2. **Documentation Method**
   - Written step-by-step instructions
   - Screen recordings/videos of processes
   - Links to relevant tools and resources
   - Examples of completed work

3. **Organization**
   - Store in document repository
   - Organize by role/function
   - Keep documentation accessible
   - Maintain version control

### Best Practices
- Document while performing tasks
- Use clear, simple language
- Include visual aids when possible
- Update as processes change
- Test with new team members

## Next Steps
With standard operating procedures documented, you have completed the implementation of all ten steps. Continue to refine and improve each component as part of the ongoing spiraling process.
