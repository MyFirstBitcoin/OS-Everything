# Step 6: Scope of Work Documents (SOW)

## Purpose
Scope of Work documents transform the high-level responsibilities from the accountability chart into detailed job descriptions. These documents serve as agreements between the organization and team members, clearly outlining expectations, duties, and success metrics for each role.

### Key Objectives
- Define clear role expectations
- Set specific performance metrics
- Guide professional development
- Support performance evaluation

## Implementation

   - Create a copy for each role
   - Follow the established format

2. **Customize Key Sections**
   - Role Description: Adapt to specific position
   - Responsibilities: Align with accountability chart
   - Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Define measurable outcomes
   - 6-Month Outcome: Set specific goals for the position

3. **Review and Finalize**
   - Ensure alignment with accountability chart
   - Verify measurable outcomes
   - Get leadership approval
   - Share with team member

### Best Practices
- Keep descriptions clear and specific
