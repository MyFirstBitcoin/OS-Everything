# My First Bitcoin Operating System

## Overview
The My First Bitcoin Operating System is a comprehensive framework that we use to run our organization. We created this system to ensure clarity, accountability, and effective execution across our team. By open-sourcing it, we aim to help other organizations, particularly those in the Bitcoin education space, develop strong operational foundations.

## The Spiraling Process

Implementation of this operating system follows a spiraling process rather than a linear one. Think of it as an upward spiral where each rotation through the steps builds upon and refines the previous iteration. This allows organizations to:
- Start with basic versions of each component
- Continuously improve based on experience
- Adapt to changing needs
- Maintain flexibility while building structure
- Learn and adjust as the organization grows

## The 10 Steps
1. [**Annual Vision Plan**: Define clear organizational direction and goals](https://github.com/MyFirstBitcoin/OS-Everything/tree/587f25002295ed3cdc5b92344e4012db8119de0b/Operations%20%26%20Fundraising/Internal%20Docs/Operating%20System/Step%201%3A%20Annual%20Vision%20Plan)
2. [**Document Repository**: Create organized storage for all documents](https://github.com/MyFirstBitcoin/OS-Everything/tree/0ede98fd3e6beffb465a65523ae5b78cf0b12a28/Operations%20%26%20Fundraising/Internal%20Docs/Operating%20System/Step%202%3A%20Document%20Repository%20Structure) 
3. **Weekly Team Meetings**: Establish regular proof-of-work sharing

5. **Accountability Chart**: Define roles and responsibilities
6. **Scope of Work**: Create detailed job descriptions
7. **OKRs**: Set objectives and key results for each role

10. **Standard Operating Procedures**: Document key processes
