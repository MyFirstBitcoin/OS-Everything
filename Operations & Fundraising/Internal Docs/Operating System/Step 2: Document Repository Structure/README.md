# Step 2: Document Repository Structure

## Purpose
A well-organized document repository ensures that all team members can easily find, access, and contribute to organizational documents. While we use Google Workspace at My First Bitcoin, any collaborative platform (Microsoft 365, Notion, etc.) can be used as long as it allows for organized file storage, clear permissions management, and real-time collaboration. This guide will use Google Workspace as an example, but the principles can be applied to any platform.

### Key Objectives
- Centralize all organizational documents
- Establish clear access permissions
- Create intuitive folder organization
- Enable efficient document retrieval
- Maintain document version control

## Implementation

### Setup Process
1. **Choose a Platform**
   - Select a collaborative platform that meets your needs
   - Key requirements:
     * File storage and organization
     * Permission management
     * Real-time collaboration
     * Version control
     * Easy sharing and access

2. **Create Base Structure**
   - Set up main departmental folders
   - Establish shared drives for cross-functional work
   - Create template directories

2. **Configure Access Permissions**
   - Define access levels (View, Comment, Edit)
   - Set up department-specific permissions
   - Create sharing groups based on roles

3. **Organize Documents**
   - Move existing documents to appropriate folders
   - Implement standard naming conventions
   - Archive outdated materials

4. **Train Team Members**
   - Share folder structure guide
   - Explain access permissions
   - Demonstrate document management best practices

### Best Practices
- Keep folder structure shallow (maximum 3-4 levels deep)
- Use clear, descriptive folder names
- Maintain consistent organization across departments
- Regularly review and clean up documents
- Store templates in dedicated folders
