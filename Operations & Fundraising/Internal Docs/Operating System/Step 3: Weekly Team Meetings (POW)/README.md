# Step 3: Weekly Team Meetings (POW)

## Purpose
Weekly team meetings provide a structured format for the entire organization to synchronize and share progress. Drawing inspiration from Bitcoin, we use the term "Proof of Work" (POW) to describe these meetings where team members demonstrate their contributions from the previous week. These meetings are essential for maintaining alignment, sharing progress, and ensuring accountability across the organization.

### Key Objectives
- Maintain organizational alignment
- Share progress and blockers
- Foster team collaboration and transparency
- Ensure accountability through regular updates
- Track progress toward vision goals

## Implementation

1. **Schedule Setup**
   - Choose a consistent weekly time
   - Set up recurring calendar invite
   - Include video conference link for remote participants
   - Allocate 1 hour for the meeting

2. **Meeting Structure**
   - Share POW template with all team members
   - Assign meeting facilitator (typically Operations Lead)
   - Operations Lead prepares the weekly agenda by copying and pasting the template into the agenda document before each meeting

   - Establish timeboxing for updates

3. **Execution**
