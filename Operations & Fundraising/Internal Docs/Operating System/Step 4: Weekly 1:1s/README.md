# Step 4: Weekly 1:1s

## Purpose
Weekly one-on-one meetings create a structured communication channel between leadership levels, ensuring clear alignment, providing regular feedback, and maintaining strong working relationships throughout the organization.

### Key Objectives
- Ensure consistent communication flow
- Provide dedicated time for feedback and guidance
- Address challenges and blockers
- Track individual progress and growth
- Maintain alignment across organizational levels

## Implementation

### Meeting Structure
1. **Leadership Hierarchy**
   - Board President ⟷ Operations Lead
   - Operations Lead ⟷ Department Directors
   - Department Directors ⟷ Staff Members

2. **Schedule Setup**
   - Set consistent weekly time slots
   - Create recurring calendar invites
   - Include video conference links
   - Allocate 30-60 minutes per meeting

3. **Agenda Format**
   The agenda is structured into three main sections:
   - **Current Projects**: Based on individual OKRs
   - **New Opportunities**: Space for discussing emerging ideas and possibilities
   - **Action Items**: Tasks and follow-ups from previous meetings

4. **Meeting Flow**
   - Begin by reviewing previous action items
   - Provide updates on current projects
   - Discuss any new opportunities
   - Document new action items

5. **Agenda Management**

### Best Practices
